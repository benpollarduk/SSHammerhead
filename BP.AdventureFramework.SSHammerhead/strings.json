  "Title": "Trouble aboard the SS HammerHead",
  "About": "This is a short demo game using the BP.AdventureFramework.",
  "Introduction": "After years of absence, the SS Hammerhead reappeared in the delta quadrant of the CTY-1 solar system.\n\nA ship was hurriedly prepared and scrambled and made contact 27 days later.\n\nYou enter the outer most airlock and it closes behind you. With a sense of foreboding you see your ship detach from the airlock and retreat to a safe distance.",
  "CTY-1 Galaxy": "A solar system in deep space, part of the SR389 galaxy.",
  "SS Hammerhead": "The star ship Hammerhead.",
  "Airlock": "The airlock is a small, mostly empty, chamber with two thick doors. One leads in to the ship, the other back to deep space.",
  "Engine Room": "This area hosts the large engine that used to power the SS HammerHead. It is now dormant and eerily silent, the fusion mechanism long since powered down. The room itself is very industrial, with metal walkways surrounding the perimeter of the room and the engine itself. A ladder leads upwards from one of these walkways.",
  "Supply Room": "The supply room is the rough shape and size of the air lock, but has been used by the crew as a makeshift supply room, containing everything from spare parts for the ship to first aid kits."
