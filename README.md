## Overview
*Trouble aboard the SS Hammerhead* is a text adventure set within a small ship that is drifting through space. Can you unravel the mystery and make it out alive before you succumb to whatever horrors lie in wait on the ship? 

While a game in its own right, *Trouble aboard the SS Hammerhead* aims to provide an extended tutorial for the [NetAF](https://github.com/benpollarduk/netaf) library.

> **NOTE:** *Trouble aboard the SS Hammerhead* is very early in development and remains a work in progress.
>
> Very little work has been done on the writing and overall story so far.
>
> Currently all effort is being spent making sure that the various mechanics and ideas are being tested to ensure that NetAF is capable of providing as rich of an experience as desired.

### Story
After years of absence, the SS Hammerhead reappeared in the delta quadrant of the CTY-1 solar system. A ship was hurriedly prepared and scrambled and made contact 27 days later.
You enter the outermost airlock, and it closes behind you. With a sense of foreboding you see your ship detach from the airlock and retreat to a safe distance.

### Premise
You take the role of Naomi Martin a 32-year-old shuttle mechanic. Throughout the course of the story you must navigate through the ship and interact with the various items and the environment
to progress through the story and unravel the mysteries of the ship.

Take control of the mighty *Spider Maintenance Bot* and use it to explore inaccessible regions of the ship from a different perspective:

The *SS Hammerhead* itself is a multi-level ship, you will need to work your way towards the bridge as you progress through the game. What will you find when you get there, and importantly,
are you truly aboard on your own?
